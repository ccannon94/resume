# Christopher Cannon Resume

This is my resume, a living document that will continue to reflect me as a professional software developer.

To generate PDFs for printing and sharing with recruiters, I am attempting to utilize (wkhtml-to-pdf)[https://wkhtmltopdf.org] or (Prince)[https://www.princexml.com].

This resume gratefully uses the template created by Thomas Hardy, available [here](http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template).
